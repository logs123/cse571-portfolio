Our MCTS agent was created to play pacman.

In our improved MCTS we add heuristic evaluation to our simulation state in order to better choose actions which leads to a better performance.

**Sample commands on how to run the pacman game individually against the MCTS agents**
Run base MCTSAgent: python pacman.py -p MCTSAgent -l smallClassic

Run improved MCTSAgent: python pacman.py -p ImprovedMCTSAgent -l smallClassic

**Command to run the test script used to generate results**
python runTests.py
